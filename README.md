# password_less
The goal of this project is to show users how to keep their accounts safe even if an attacker manages to access the server and obtain their userid and secret key.
Numerous services, like Oauth, OpenID, SAML, JWT, and Kerberos, among others, exist to manage this procedure. 
The issue with these password-less services is that they are useless if an attacker manages to access the account and obtain the secret key. 
To remember this part of the activity, I utilised a pattern key, which is a means to log into an account in a unique fashion that an attacker cannot discover even if the account is compromised.

I've included a link to my live project below.
